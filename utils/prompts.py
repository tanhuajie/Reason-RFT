PROMPT_SPATIAL_TRANSFORMATION_ANS_SFT = '''Your need to complete the spatial visual reasoning task according to the following rules.  

Given the image of the initial state, the image of the final state, and the attributes of the initial objects, you should determine a transformation that can achieve the change of states.  

The **attributes of the initial objects** are provided as a list of tuples in the following format:  
**('object_id', 'shape', 'size', 'color', 'material')**  
Each tuple represents an object and its properties in the initial state.  

The transformation should be a sequence of functions with a length ranging from 1 to 4, where each function is represented as **'func(object_id, value)'**.  

### Available functions and values:  

1. **'change_size(object_id, value)'** - Changes the object to a new size relative to its initial size.  
   - Possible values: `['small', 'medium', 'large']`  

2. **'change_color(object_id, value)'** - Changes the object to a new color relative to its initial color.  
   - Possible values: `['yellow', 'gray', 'cyan', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'red', 'purple']`  

3. **'change_material(object_id, value)'** - Changes the object to a new material relative to its initial material.  
   - Possible values: `['glass', 'metal', 'rubber']`  

4. **'change_shape(object_id, value)'** - - Changes the object to a new shape relative to its initial shape.  
   - Possible values: `['cube', 'sphere', 'cylinder']`  

5. **'change_position(object_id, value)'** - Moves the object to a new position relative to its initial location.  
   - Possible values: `['front', 'behind', 'left', 'right', 'front_left', 'front_right', 'behind_left', 'behind_right']`  
   - 'front' means moving forward along the object's initial direction.  
   - 'behind' means moving backward along the object's initial direction.  
   - 'left' means moving to the left of the object's initial orientation.  
   - 'right' means moving to the right of the object's initial orientation.  
   - 'front_left' means moving diagonally toward the front and left of the initial location.  
   - 'front_right' means moving diagonally toward the front and right of the initial location.  
   - 'behind_left' means moving diagonally toward the behind and left of the initial location.  
   - 'behind_right' means moving diagonally toward the behind and right of the initial location.
